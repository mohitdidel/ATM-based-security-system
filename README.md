üîê Biometric-Based ATM Security System

üß† About the Project This project aims to enhance ATM security using biometric authentication. Instead of using a PIN, users register and authenticate using their fingerprint. The fingerprint data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and stored securely in a local SQLite database. The system includes a GUI for ease of use, developed with Python's tkinter.

üöÄ Installation

Clone the Repository git clone (https://github.com/mohitdidel/ATM-based-security-system) cd biometric-atm-security

Install Dependencies pip install pycryptodome pillow

Run the Application python gui_app.py

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Register a User ->Enter a username. ->Select a .png fingerprint image file. ->Click on "Register Fingerprint".

Authenticate a User ->Enter the registered username. ->Provide the fingerprint image again. ->Click on "Authenticate" to validate identity.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The system compares fingerprint images as binary files. For a more advanced comparison, integration with OpenCV or ML-based fingerprint matching can be implemented.
